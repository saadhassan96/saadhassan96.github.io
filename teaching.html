            </li> Course Instructor <br> The aim of this course is to provide the student with an introduction to the main concepts and techniques required for collecting, processing, and deriving insight into data. Data Science is an interdisciplinary set of topics that includes everything you need to create data driven answers and solutions to specific business, scientific, or sociological questions. Topics typically covered include an introduction to one or more data collection and management systems, e.g., SQL, web scraping, and various data repositories; exploratory and statistical data analysis, e.g., bootstrapping, measures of central tendency, hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques including linear regression and clustering; data and information visualization, e.g., plotting and interactive charts using various technologies; and presentation and communication of the results of these analyses. <br>

            </li> Course Instructor <br> This course is designed for both graduate and undergraduate students interested in understanding fundamental theories, techniques, and research methods in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). HCI is the interdisciplinary study of designing, evaluating, and improving interactive computer systems to enhance user experiences and optimize human-technology interactions. In the first of the two parts of the course, we will immerse ourselves in a dynamic exploration of the foundations of HCI, delving into relevant aspects of cognitive psychology, human factors, user and task analysis, accessibility, interaction design methods, techniques, and evaluation. Through in-class activities, assignments, and an exam, students will gain familiarity with key concepts and paradigms in HCI and strengthen their knowledge in these areas. In the second part, we will unravel the nature of research typically performed in an HCI context and explore interdisciplinary processes and methodologies. It will culminate in hands-on projects tailored to the respective levels of graduate and undergraduate students. <br>

            <br> During this course, students will have the opportunity to design a proposal for a capstone project that applies relevant theories and methodologies to address a problem in the HCI domain. Throughout the course, they will receive guidance from the instructor as they investigate the problem space, conduct a thorough literature review, develop a clear problem statement, write a comprehensive proposal detailing their intended design and implementation of a solution, and effectively communicate the proposal to potential capstone committee members. <br>

            <br> In this course, students will become familiar with practical issues involved in specifying, designing, developing, and testing software systems. They will also be introduced to the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the standard tool used for expressing designs in software engineering. The main focus of the course is a semester-long, small-group collaborative project in which students apply their newly acquired technical skills and understanding of the software development life cycle models to real-world problems. Through this project, students will gain valuable experience in project management, communication, problem-solving, and team collaboration.
